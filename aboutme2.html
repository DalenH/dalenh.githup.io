    My name is DALEN HEANG. I'm one of the 110 students in Liger Leadership Academy.  
    I was born on 9 September 2005. I'm from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siem_Reap" target="_">Siem Reap</a>, a province full of tourist sites where rocks, temples, and sculptures tell unique stories. 
    As a 14 years old girl, I'm interested in learning about the world. 
    Apart from that, I very much enjoy dancing. I'm fascinated by the creation of the dance moves and how it goes along with the music so well. 
    I like all the subjects that were provided in school but my all-time favorite is Current Events. 
    I love reading books and watching movies. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolls_(film)" target="_">Trolls</a> is one of my most loved movies. 
    I enjoy a lot of different movie genre including musical, action, and horror. 
    I currently don't have any dream job but as I grow older, I hope to explore different fields before picking a specific career.
